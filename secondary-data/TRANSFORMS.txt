We have three datasets

1. iml_2018_modeled: 
public_resource: primary key is MID

2. edge_1718_modeled:
postsecondary_school: primary key is SCHOOLID
private_school: primary key is SCHOOLID
public_school: primary key is SCHOOLID

3. uds_mapper:
zip_to_zcta5: primary key is ZIPCODE
Note: However, ZIPCODE and ZCTA5 needs some transformation to be consistent with primary key in primary dataset and other secondary dataset
