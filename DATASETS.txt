Our primary dataset are a collection of American Community Survey (ACS) from the U.S Census Bureau in 2018. The dataset contains information focus on economic characteristics of the community relating to where they live and how they live. There are 4 files from the collection that we decided to explore corresponding to 4 key files explaining the fields.
These datasets are organized by geography ID and the ZCTA number, which are used to enable longitudinal matches among all files. The datasets might be filtered to remove unrelatable fields.

1. economics: this file contains information about employment status, occupation, income, insurance coverage and financial status of each ZCTA number (550 fields)

**We hope to gain insights into these areas:**

1. Which area has the highest housing value? Which area has the residents with the highest income? Any relationships between them?
2. Which area needs the government’s attention? Poverty level? Crime rate?
3. Do any neighborhoods that are close to each other but differ in income/house value/education level a lot?
4. Which area attracts more people to rent than to buy?
5. Which area/neighborhood has better health services?Connecting that, which area/neighborhood is currently more demanding?


# Secondary datasets
## Institute of Museum and Library Services - Museum Universe - 1 file
[link](https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/museum-data-files)
It includes basic information on aquariums, arboretums, botanical gardens, art museums, children's museums, general museums, historic houses and sites, history museums, nature centers, natural history and anthropology museums, planetariums, science and technology centers, specialized museums, and zoos in zip code.

**We hope to gain insights into these areas:**

1. Any co-relation between where theses public resources located vs living condition of the neighborhood nearby?
2. How much revenue they generated? How much tax they paid?



## Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates 2017-2018 - 3 files
[link] (https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/SchoolLocations)
This dataset include information about Public School, Private School and Postsecondary School in 2017-2018 in zip code.

**We hope to gain insights into these areas:**

1. Which neighborhood has better education quantitatively and qualitatively?
2. Does the education and its demand in a certain neighborhood/area need more attention from the government?


## Zipcode to ZCTA5 - 1 file
