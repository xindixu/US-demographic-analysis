**We hope to gain insights into these areas:**

1. Which area has the highest housing value? Which area has the residents with the highest income? Any relationships between them?
2. Which area needs the governmentâ€™s attention? Poverty level? Maybe the crime rate?
3. Do any neighborhoods that are close to each other but differ in income/house value/education level a lot?
4. Which area attracts more people to rent than to buy?
5. Which area/neighborhood has better health services?Connecting that, which area/neighborhood is currently more demanding?
